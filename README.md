## About
This is a program that pulls two random anime titles from https://hummingbird.me/ and posts a tweet recommending the two anime on https://twitter.com/MAL_Recs. It is deployed on Heroku and uses the addon Heroku scheduler to run the program every hour.

Note that in order to run the program, you will need to enter in the API keys from Twitter in the twitter.properties file, which you can apply for at https://dev.twitter.com/.
